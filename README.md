## A Twitch Bot
### That's not so great right now.

I started writing a bot for a stream idea for playing retro games. Everything I found for Linux just wasn't what I wanted.

TODO:
* ~~Refactor the fuck out of this.~~
* Refactor this more.
* Build out the dashboard nicer.
* ~~Build out an overlay.~~
* Build better overlay.
* ~~Database integration. MySQL/MariaDB probably.~~
* SQLite is probably fine, but maybe do MySQL anyways still.
* Add more commands.
* Timers.
* Ideally learn React.
* Implement JWST or a better OAuth refresh method that doesn't use cookies.
