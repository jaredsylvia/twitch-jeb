# Twitch Jeb
## A Twitch Bot
### That's not so great right now.

I started writing a bot for a stream idea for playing retro games. Everything I found for Linux just wasn't what I wanted.

TODO:
* Refactor the fuck out of this.
* Build out the dashboard nicer.
* Build out an overlay.
* Database integration. MySQL/MariaDB probably.
* Ideally learn React.
